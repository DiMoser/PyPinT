*PyPinT* is a framework for Parallel-in-Time integration routines.

The main purpose of *PyPinT* is to provide a framework for educational use and
prototyping new parallel-in-time algorithms.
As well it will aid in developing a high-performance C++ implementation for
massively parallel computers providing the benefits of parallel-in-time
routines to a zoo of time integrators in various applications.
